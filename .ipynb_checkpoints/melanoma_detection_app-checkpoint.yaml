faqs:
- answer: The accuracy of the models varies. For example, EfficientNetB4 has the highest
    accuracy of 85% for dermoscopic images, while ResNet50 has 79% accuracy for skin
    lesions. Check the Model Performance page for detailed metrics.
  question: How accurate are the models used in this app?
- answer: This app is intended for educational and informational purposes only. For
    accurate medical diagnosis, consult a healthcare professional.
  question: Can I trust the results of this app for medical diagnosis?
- answer: You can upload both skin images and dermoscopic images. The app will automatically
    select the appropriate model for analysis.
  question: What types of images can I upload for detection?
- answer: The app provides a classification of either Melanoma (Malignant) or Not
    Melanoma (Benign) with a confidence score indicating the model's certainty.
  question: How do I interpret the prediction results?
- answer: No, your images are only used for the current session and are not stored
    or used for any other purpose.
  question: Is my uploaded image stored or used for other purposes?
